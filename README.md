> A tiny (~1.6KB), universal, zero-dependency localized address formatter for postal addresses.

This package uses [address metadata](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata)
from Google's [Address Data Service](https://chromium-i18n.appspot.com/ssl-address/data) to format _postal addresses_ from all over the world.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install tinyaddress
```

or using `yarn`

```bash
$ yarn add tinyaddress
```

## Usage

```ts
import { formatAddress } from "tinyaddress";

const address = formatAddress({
  name: "Mr John Smith",
  region: "New York",
  city: "Kingston",
  addressLines: ["132, My Street"],
  postalCode: "12401",
  countryCode: "US",
});

/* 
	["Mr John Smith",
	"132, My Street",
	"Kingston, New York 12401"]
*/
```

`formatAddress` returns an array of sorted lines which can then be joined to generate a string.
This can be done automatically by passing `string` as `options.output`:

```ts
import { formatAddress } from "tinyaddress";

const address = formatAddress(
  {
    name: "Mr John Smith",
    region: "New York",
    city: "Kingston",
    addressLines: ["132, My Street"],
    postalCode: "12401",
    countryCode: "US",
  },
  { output: "string" }
);

/*
	"Mr John Smith
	132, My Street
	Kingston, New York 12401
*/
```
